# ML Predictive Modeling - Bike Rental Demand Prediction

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict bicycle rental demand using regression analysis and advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop machine learning models to predict bicycle rental demand
- **Data**: Bicycle rental dataset
- **Technology**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning

## Analysis Structure

### Part 1: Linear Regression
- **Multiple Linear Regression Models**: Build models using variables such as temperature, humidity, windspeed, weather conditions, holidays, and interaction terms
- **Coefficient Interpretation**: Analyze the relationship between predictors and bike rentals through coefficient interpretation
- **Statistical Testing**: Perform hypothesis testing (F-test) and model comparisons
- **Business Insights**: Analyze differences in rental behavior between registered and casual users to provide actionable business insights

### Part 2: Machine Learning
